# Movie_Site
This website is designed to showcase my proficiency in HTML and CSS, emphasizing a modern and visually appealing user interface with responsive and interactive elements. The structure of the site is clean, organized, and functional, featuring various common website components, such as a navigation bar, search bar, card-based movie display, and a footer.

1. Navbar & User Interface
The navbar is styled with a sleek, slate-gray background, providing a polished and modern look.
It uses flexbox to ensure elements align neatly and responsively.
Font styling, including the use of custom fonts like 'Trebuchet MS', helps give the text a clean and contemporary feel.
Interactive elements like the Sign-In button have subtle hover effects, such as scaling and shadow transitions, to enhance the user experience. This demonstrates the use of CSS transitions and hover effects to create dynamic elements.
2. Search Functionality
A search bar is placed within a styled search-container with an integrated search icon (using a Unicode emoji) that enhances the usability and design of the search functionality.
The search input field is given padding and borders with rounded corners, and the button on the right has a smooth hover effect that changes the background color when hovered.
3. Movies Card Layout
The movies display section is a grid of movie cards that dynamically adjusts based on screen size, thanks to flexbox.
Each card has a clean, minimal design with a hover effect that enlarges the card, making it more engaging for users.
The images within the cards are responsive and appropriately sized using the object-fit property, ensuring that they maintain their proportions without distorting.
4. Footer
The footer is divided into multiple panels, each with distinct styling for clarity.
The footer panels are flexbox-based, ensuring the content remains properly aligned across different devices.
Subtle touches like border styling and color contrast improve readability and provide a balanced visual appeal.
5. Aesthetic Enhancements
The use of color transitions, hover animations, and box shadows across buttons, links, and other elements contributes to a smooth and user-friendly design.
Typography is optimized for readability and style, with custom font families for a modern touch and proper font sizing for hierarchical clarity.
Responsive design principles are incorporated through flexbox and other layout techniques, ensuring that the site looks great on both small and large screens.
